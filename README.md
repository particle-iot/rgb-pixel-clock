# RGB Pixel Clock Kit

### Introduction

The RGB Pixel Clock is based on the latest (v4) version of the RGB Matrix Shield designed by @peekay123.  The shield allows a Particle Photon or Electron to interface directly with one or two (daisy chained) 32x32 RGB Matrix panels to display color images and text.  An onboard microSD socket allows images and files to be accessed from the Particle device to display, for example, animated GIF files and images on the RGB panel.  The RGB shield conveniently plugs directly into the back of the RGB Panel, providing a low-profile fit.

NOTE: The kit is not compatible with the older Spark Core.

### Assembly Guide

If a new unconfigured Photon or Electron is used, the following startup guides are recommended:

#The RGB Matrix Shield
The small board provided with the kit is the RGB Matrix Shield, as shown in these top and bottom views:

1. Assemble the shield-to-panel power plug by inserting both red wires into the "+" terminal of the screw terminal and tighening the screw to secure the wires.  Do the same with the black wires, inserting them into the "GND" terminal.  The completed assembly looks as follows:

2. Insert a Photon or Electron into the shield, making sure the USB connector is next to the microSD socket as shown below:

NOTE: The Electron is longer than the shield board and some of its pins will "dangle" beyond the edged.  This is normal:
