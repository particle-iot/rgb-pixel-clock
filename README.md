# RGB Pixel Clock Kit

### Introduction

The RGB Pixel Clock is based on the latest (v4) version of the RGB Matrix Shield designed by @peekay123.  The shield allows a Particle Photon or Electron to interface directly with one or two (daisy chained) 32x32 RGB Matrix panels to display color images and text.  An onboard microSD socket allows images and files to be accessed from the Particle device to display, for example, animated GIF files and images on the RGB panel.  The RGB shield conveniently plugs directly into the back of the RGB Panel for a nice low-profile fit.

NOTE: The kit is not compatible with the older Spark Core.
